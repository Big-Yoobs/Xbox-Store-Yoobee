# Xbox-Store-Yoobee

As part of our Bachelors in Software Engineering, Thomas Richards (@tomphonse) and Isaiah Meek (@eyezahhhh) have developed a new and improved version of the Xbox Store website with a sleek and intuitive design. Our goal was to make it easier for users to find and purchase their favorite Xbox games, accessories, and more. To achieve this we streamlined a lot of the functionality and added a rich presence of media and visuals.
